# WASim
A (very) experimental WebAssembly Simulator

Uses a client server architecture:

* Server side code written in Go
* WebUI written in Go WebAssembly
* The Simulator data provided by a modified version of [Olin](https://github.com/Xe/olin)
  * This will probably be turned into a PR for Olin later, so it can be merged back in

Concept mock up:
